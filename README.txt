My development on a tracker for the tello drone.
The stc_py is got some python script in it that I used to understand and test the tello drone cabaility.  The fly drone py file gives you the abiliity to see throught the drone camera and fly it using keyboard controls.
The drenv is a virtual env that has all the package you need to run the python drone development.
the ctello folder has the drone development code for a c++ platmore interacting with the tello drone.  This folder also has project files for using nsight to build code and tesing.
