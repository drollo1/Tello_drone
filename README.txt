My development of a tracker for the tello drone.
The stc_py is got some python script in it that I used to understand and test the tello drone cabaility.  The fly drone py file gives you the ability to see throught the drone camera and fly it using keyboard controls.
The ctello folder has the drone development code for a c++ platform interacting with the tello drone.  This folder also has project files for using nsight to build code and tesing.
